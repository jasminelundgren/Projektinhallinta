<h2>Turo</h2>


<p>Turo is an 11-year-old cat, and he moved in a year ago, when his former owner brought him to us. He’s very bold and social, and he quickly became the leader of out pack. He enjoys himself around humans, but be careful not to leave your plate around, because Turo is quickly there to eat your food.</p>
